# Web Media Catalog Service
## PPY_Project_2023
Our project is a web application with the following functionalities:

1. Login/registration system for users;
2. Storing and displaying the information about different works of fiction (description, cover, name, etc.), which are available on the internet (e.g. movies, novels, comics, anime);
3. Ratings and comment systems, which allow users to leave a feedback and share their opinions about pieces of art presented on the website;
4. Searching and sorting systems, which allow users to browse the website to find the desired product. Sorting will be implmented in forms of the categories and filters, which users can use during the search.
5. Users will have ability to download the desired piece of media, if they want to.
